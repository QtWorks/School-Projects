Dashboard is the home page. I've tried to make everything self-explanitory, but I hope it's intuitive enough to make for easy grading.

There's no CSS. Any time a visit is added, it's added to the "cart", which has a link at the bottom of the screen to confirm

Dates are in format MM/DD/YYYY. Email tanner.barlow@utah.edu with any questions!

Thanks TAs! You've been great. Like I said, I know you have a TON of grading to do and I hope this isn't one of the complicated ones!
