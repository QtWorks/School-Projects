OUR PROJECT IS NOT DONE

## Design Decisions:
- painting strings instead of using labels
- format of splash screen
- holding team members in the world class to make them more accessable
- Only update when we get new data

## Features we wish the graders to be aware of:
- Centered Players' Names
- Display error when connecting to nonexistant server
- Allow player to restart game upon death
- Zoom in on current player
- Show some statistics on player when they die
